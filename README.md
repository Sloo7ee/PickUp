# PickUp
 ## Introduction  Welcome to our project, a web application designed to facilitate the process of parents picking up their children from school. The project aims to address common challenges parents face, such as waiting for a teacher to bring their child outside the school premises. The solution involves creating a system where parents can submit a request for their child's release, and the teacher receives immediate notification to assist in the timely pickup.  ## Project Features  ### Parent Features  1. **Login/Authentication:**    - Parents can log in using their username and password.    - User authentication is handled securely.  2. **Request Child Pickup:**    - Parents can create a request for picking up their child.    - The system records essential details, such as the child's name, date of birth, and the parent's information.  ### Teacher Features  1. **Login/Authentication:**    - Teachers can log in using their username and password.    - User authentication is handled securely.  2. **View Callouts:**    - Teachers can view all pending pickup requests (callouts) assigned to them.  3. **Update Callout Status:**    - Teachers can update the status of a callout, marking it as "sendout" after assisting the parent.  4. **Update Student Information:**    - Teachers can update the information of a student, such as assigning them to a specific class and connecting them to the teacher.  ### Admin Features  1. **Login/Authentication:**    - Admins can log in using their username and password.    - User authentication is handled securely.  2. **Manage Users:**    - Admins can view and manage information about fathers, teachers, and admins.  3. **View All Callouts:**    - Admins can view all pickup requests made by parents.  4. **View All Classes and Teachers:**    - Admins can view information about all classes and teachers.  ## Installation and Setup  To run the project locally, follow these steps:  1.

Configure the database:     - Ensure that you have a running database server.    - Update the database configuration in the `config/db.ts` file.  4. Start the server:     ```bash    npm start    ```  5.
